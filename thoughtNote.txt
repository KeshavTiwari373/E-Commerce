1) Made Header and footer files separate and included in all the pages using javascript
   fetch method and also created header and footer dynamically using DOM createElement() method.
   Removed bootstrap links from header and footer files to prevent overridden situation as i'm 
   including bootstrap links in all the pages.

2) used more and more semantic tags in all the pages. 
    Also followed DRY method.
    Created all the pages in this structure:

        <Body>                made it Flex
            <Header></Header> dynamically generated
            <Main></Main>     only allowed main to flex-grow
            <Footer></Footer> dynamically generated
        </Body>

    As i fetched Header dynamically and inside header file i included this using internal CSS
        it getting applied to all the pages.

3) there were 10 products pages and created them all separately and 
    used common CSS file for all of them.
    To get card of same height in each row i used the following CSS
        .card {
        height: 100%; /* Set a fixed height for the cards */
        }

        .card img {
        object-fit: cover; /* Ensure images maintain aspect ratio and cover the container */
        height: 100%; /* Make sure the image fills the entire height of the card */
        }
    Also used javascript to give value to all the "alt of the images" using DOM Manipulation.

4) Contact and login pages like all other pages made using grid system and have a common CSS file.
    Menu pages had 2 parts so created under 2 sections. 
    All the pages are responsive for small, medium and large devices.
    Cart page build using grid system and second part i created using float properties inside Grid column.

5) Used padding and margin properties as per requirements like to separate cards 
        and sections from header and footer.
    Gave hover effect to the buttons.
    Used more and more bootstrap classes to make it less complicated.
    All the code files are neat, with structured folders, and comments added to
        segregate the sections
    Created all the given pages with relevant specifications as mentioned.
